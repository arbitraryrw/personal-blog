# About Me
My name is Nikola Cucakovic, I'm a Senior Security Consultant Synopsys. I have spent 4 years working in software development and in software security. This background empowers me to appreciate pentesting / development from multiple perspectives and have more of a holistic view.

I strongly believe in the philosophy of _â€œAnything that you do more than twice has to be automated"_, with this in mind I've developed many static and dynamic analysis testing tools. Some of these tools can be found in my GitHub [here](https://github.com/arbitraryrw).
