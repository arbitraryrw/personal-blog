# About Me

My name is Nikola Cucakovic, I'm a Senior Security Consultant Synopsys. I've spent a number of years working in tech, both from a security and engineering perspective. This background empowers me to appreciate pentesting / development from multiple perspectives and have a more holistic view. I strongly believe in the philosophy of _â€œAnything that you do more than twice has to be automated"_, with this in mind I've developed many static and dynamic analysis testing tools.
