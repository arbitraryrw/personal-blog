# About Me
My name is Nikola, Iâ€™m a security engineer with a background in software development. I enjoy building and breaking things. I am particularly interested in Mobile, Web, and Cloud technologies - especially if they relate to games. I spend my time both personally and professionally writing tooling in Python, if I have to do a task more than twice I will endeavour to automate it. Some of these tools can be found in my GitHub [here](https://github.com/arbitraryrw).
