# Disclaimer
Rooting your Android device is your decision, I am by no means responsible for any damage. Proceed with caution, the process of Rooting a device can be risky, including but not limited to:

- Bricking the device, rendering it unusuable
- Voiding the device warranty
- Introducing additional security risks

# Definitions
__Rooted device__ - For the purpose of this blog post, this is defined as: _modifying the operating system so that you can run commands as the root user_. There are broader definitions that include anything that is not stock Android, such as custom ROMs, however, this is outside the scope of this post.

__Root Detection__ - Logic used to detect the presence of a rooted device. For example, the presence and or absence of files on the filesystem, binary behavioural differences, etc.

# Introduction
Dynamic security testing / research on the Android platform is almost always accomplished on a rooted device. This is because having root privilege access allows you to bypass many restrictions that are built into the platform. Making it easy to extract data from the device or tamper with applications. However, many mobile applications take it upon themselves to block access from rooted devices. This is common practice because the user has introduced a mechanism to bypass restrictions that are rightfully built into the platform. These restrictions are there to protect the user, and their data. Naturally, service providers want to reduce the potential attack surface as much as possible - blocking rooted devices is the easiest solution for that.

On the other hand, working on a non-rooted device is not a straightforward process either. Although there are methods to use bread and butter tools on non-rooted devices, such as [Frida](https://frida.re/), generally it is more cumbersome. From my experience, it often adds additional complexity and can introduce more problems than it solves. Especially when working with multiple applications. A great example of this is: to be able to use [Frida Gadget](https://frida.re/docs/gadget/) you need to repackage the application, however, by repacking the application you now need to bypass repackaging / signature detections.

The way that I usually tackle this dilemma is by using a rooted device and bypassing any root detection checks. This is not ideal as this involves individually bypassing each root detection check, in each and every application. Fortunately, there are many tools that offer effective root bypasses that work on most applications, such as [Objection](https://github.com/sensepost/objection). The real problem lies with the applications that have sophisticated / custom root detection checks. Do you accept defeat, manually reverse the application, and write a custom hook? Or do you tackle the problem instead of the symptom? I’ve opted for the latter and will present the solution here.

# Background 
There are many different methodologies / approaches when it comes to root detection. For the purposes of this post, it is important to understand that many root detection methodologies are primarily built on detecting the presence of files on disk. For example, detecting the presence of the `su` binary on disk, or a root management application such as [SuperSu](https://supersuroot.org/) or [Magisk](https://magiskmanager.com/) is an obvious red flag. There is no ambiguity, if a device has these files on disk there is an almost 100% chance the device is rooted.

Notably, there are additional methods for detecting if the device is rooted that are not so straight forward. Such as checking file system permissions, system properties, or even how the OS was signed (test / prod keys). Many of these checks are not individually enough to say the device is definitely rooted. For example, it is not uncommon for custom ROMs to be signed using test keys, or ROMs to ship with different utilities. Often these checks are only used to support the file system checks to provide further assurance. 

A more in depth breakdown of the individual techniques can be found in the [MSTG - Testing Root Detection](https://mobile-security.gitbook.io/mobile-security-testing-guide/android-testing-guide/0x05j-testing-resiliency-against-reverse-engineering#testing-root-detection-mstg-resilience-1) gitbook. This is a great resource and I would highly recommend it.

# Walkthrough

### Setup
- [android platform tools (adb / fastboot)](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools)
- unlock bootloader
- SuperSu version
- [TWRP](https://twrp.me/) / twrp version

SuperSu Download [here](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/supersu/2014-09-02-supersu-v2-05-t2868133), this is version SR5-SuperSU-v2.82-SR5-20171001224502.



### Applying the Patch to SuperSu
- clone repo
- python dependencies
- run the tool

Clone repo
```git
git clone git@github.com:arbitraryrw/supersu-patcher.git
```

Install dependencies (maybe introduce virtual env?)
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Patch the file:
```bash
python3 run.py -i ./SR5-SuperSU-v2.82-SR5-20171001224502.zip
```
Patching output

```bash

### Installation
- boot to TWRP image
- install patched SuperSu using TWRP

- List all devices: https://twrp.me/Devices/

```
No it's the internal codename for the device used for identification purposes. It's dumpling for the 5t, cheeseburger for the 5, most devices(OnePlus or not) have code names.
```

Boot device into fastboot
```
adb reboot bootloader
```

Check the device is connected via fastboot

```
fastboot devices
<hash>	fastboot
```

Download TWRP for your device, unfortunately all of the official builds from TWRP did not work for me. I resorted to using an official [TWRP version](https://forum.xda-developers.com/oneplus-5t/development/recovery-twrp-3-2-1-0-oreo-8-0-8-1-t3729673) for my OnePlus 5T (codename Dumpling).

```
fastboot boot twrp-3.2.3-0-20180822-codeworkx-dumpling.img
Sending 'boot.img' (26944 KB)                      OKAY [  0.599s]
Booting                                            OKAY [  0.013s]
Finished. Total time: 0.636s
```

Push patched SuperSu to device:

```
adb push patched-SR5-SuperSU-v2.82-SR5-20171001224502.zip /sdcard/
patched-SR5-SuperSU-v2.82-SR5-20171001224502.zip: 1 file pushed, 0 skipped. 28.8 MB/s (14913677 bytes in 0.494s)

# Results
- custom root working

```
adb shell
OnePlus5T:/ $ su
/system/bin/sh: su: not found
127|OnePlus5T:/ $ nu
OnePlus5T:/ # whoami
root
OnePlus5T:/ # exit
OnePlus5T:/ $ whoami
shell
```

Accessing application sandbox data:

```
OnePlus5T:/ # ls /data/data/com.oneplus.security/
cache code_cache databases shared_prefs
OnePlus5T:/ # cat /data/data/com.oneplus.security/shared_prefs/oneplus_security_preference.xml
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8' standalone='yes' ?>
<map>
    <int name="permission_switch" value="1" />
</map>
OnePlus5T:/ #
```

# Clean-up
- Remove root management apps 
- Safetynet bypass
- Kernel patch

I would highly recommend removing the management SuperSu management application as this acts as a common root detection signature.

__KERNEL PATCH CONTENT__
