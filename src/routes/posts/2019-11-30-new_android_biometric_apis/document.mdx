## Introduction
Earlier this year Google released two new APIs to handle Biometric authentication with Android 10. The [BiometricManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/biometric/BiometricManager.html#constants_1) and [BiometricPrompt](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/biometrics/BiometricPrompt) classes. The purpose of these APIs is to provide a centralised mechanism for interfacing with biometric authentication mechanisms on Android, regardless of the hardware of the device i.e fingerprint / face.

The main reason I’m writing this is because I found it very difficult to find any information on integrating [CryptoObjects](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/biometrics/BiometricPrompt.CryptoObject) with the new API, especially anything in Kotlin. With that in mind, the aim of this post is to talk about the new biometric architecture, to showcase a basic example of the new APIs using Crypto Objects, and highlight some of the inherent risks introduced with these new APIs.

## Background
The new Biometric APIs have been in alpha / beta since [last September](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/androidx.biometric/biometric), however, they have only just been fully released, as can be seen [here](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/androidx.biometric/biometric/1.0.0
). Originally it was rumoured that these APIs were to handle Facial Recognition exclusively because of this [commit](https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/frameworks/base/+/640360/), however this is not true. These APIs are built with the intention of unifying biometric authentication mechanisms. They currently support fingerprint and face authentication with the view of integrating other modalities in the future, such as [iris](https://source.android.com/security/biometric#implementation).

## New Biometric Architecture
The two new APIs superseed the old [FingerprintManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/fingerprint/FingerprintManager) that was used for handling fingerprint biometrics on Android devices. Notably, the [FingerprintManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/fingerprint/FingerprintManager) class was deprecated in API level 28. The flow diagram across android versions can be seen below, the original image can be found in the Android Developer documentation [here](https://source.android.com/security/biometric#implementation).

According to the developer documentation [here](https://source.android.com/security/biometric): `"All biometric implementations must meet security specifications and have a strong rating in order to participate in the BiometricPrompt class"`. For more information on the guidelines, see [here](https://source.android.com/compatibility/android-cdd#7_3_10_biometric_sensors) and [here](https://source.android.com/security/biometric/measure#strong-weak-unlocks).

## Project setup
In order to leverage the new APIs, the project must include the androidx biometric dependency and have the required permission present in the Android Manifest.

Add the androidx biometric library to the application by referencing it in the project's dependency list found in `app/build.gradle`, as seen below:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'androidx.biometric:biometric:1.0.0'
}
```

Add the `USE_BIOMETRIC` permission to the project's Android manifest file found in `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`, as seen below:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.USE_BIOMETRIC"
    android:requiredFeature="false"/>
```

## BiometricManager Usage
The [BiometricManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/biometric/BiometricManager.html#constants_1) class provides a centralised mechanism for querying the availability of biometric authentication on the device. Notably, under the hood this will invoke the [FingerprintManagerCompat](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/hardware/fingerprint/FingerprintManagerCompat.html) class on pre Android P devices. A simple example of how to invoke this method can be seen below:

```kotlin
when (biometricManager.canAuthenticate()) {
    BiometricManager.BIOMETRIC_SUCCESS ->
        println("Biometrics available on the device")
    BiometricManager.BIOMETRIC_ERROR_NO_HARDWARE ->
        println("No biometric features available on this device.")
    BiometricManager.BIOMETRIC_ERROR_HW_UNAVAILABLE ->
        println("Biometric features are currently unavailable.")
    BiometricManager.BIOMETRIC_ERROR_NONE_ENROLLED ->
        println("User has not setup biometrics with their account.")
}
```
The `canAuthenticate` method returns one of 4 constant values that can be used to identify the biometric status of the device. Handle and act appropriately, next let's look at leveraging biometrics into this flow.

## BiometricPrompt Usage
The [BiometricPrompt](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/biometrics/BiometricPrompt) class provides a consistent and centralised mechanism for managing the system-provided biometric dialog. First, let's look at building a prompt. This can be done by leveraging the builder method as seen below:

```kotlin
var biometricPromptInfo = BiometricPrompt.PromptInfo.Builder()
            .setTitle("Nik.re Login")
            .setSubtitle("Biometric Auth")
            .setDescription("Performing x function to do y")
            .setNegativeButtonText("Abort biometric login")
            .setConfirmationRequired(true)
            .setDeviceCredentialAllowed(false)
            .build()
```

Many of the APIs referenced in the snippet above are for setting cosmetic attributes such as `.setTitle` and `.setDescription`, used to set dialogue information. However the `setConfirmationRequired` and `setDeviceCredentialAllowed` are interesting from a security perspective.

The `setConfirmationRequired` method is used to define whether or not the dialogue should require explicit user action when performing authentication. This is important when considering implicit biometric modalities like Face and Iris authentication which are passive by design. Meaning they don't require an explicit user action to complete. It is recommended to set this flag to `true` when performing high-risk actions such as making a purchase, or sending a payment. Low-risk actions such as re-authenticating a recently authenticated session may want to consider setting this flag to `false`. More information on this API can be found [here](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/biometric/BiometricPrompt.PromptInfo.Builder#setConfirmationRequired(boolean)). See the image below for a side by side comparison.

```kotlin
biometricPrompt = BiometricPrompt(this, executor,
    object : BiometricPrompt.AuthenticationCallback() {
        override fun onAuthenticationError(errorCode: Int,
                                           errString: CharSequence) {
            super.onAuthenticationError(errorCode, errString)
            Toast.makeText(applicationContext,
                "Authentication error: $errString", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT)
                .show()
        }

        override fun onAuthenticationSucceeded(
            result: BiometricPrompt.AuthenticationResult) {
              super.onAuthenticationSucceeded(result)
              val authenticatedCryptoObject: BiometricPrompt.CryptoObject? =
                  result.getCryptoObject()
              // User has verified the signature, cipher, or message
              // authentication code (MAC) associated with the crypto object,
              // so you can use it in your app's crypto-driven workflows.


              Toast.makeText(applicationContext, "Authentication Success!",
                  Toast.LENGTH_SHORT)
                  .show()
        }

        override fun onAuthenticationFailed() {
            super.onAuthenticationFailed()
            Toast.makeText(applicationContext, "Authentication failed",
                Toast.LENGTH_SHORT)
                .show()
        }
    })
```

## Conclusion
The new Biometric APIs provide an easy to use solution for handling biometrics on Android. The abstracted logic makes it easy for a developer to integrate biometric authentication without having to worry about the modality supported by the device, i.e face / finger / iris. Additionally, from a development perspective the lifecycle aware and consistent UI components are really nice to work with.

With that being said, from a security perspective, these new biometric APIs introduce a risk by not allowing developers to control / restrict biometric modalities. Organisations may not feel comfortable with biometric x but may be comfortable with biometric y. Especially when handling sensitive information such as the key example in this post. Ideally, these APIs should provide some mechanism to control this, such as via an initialisation flag to BiometricPrompt or a Manifest permission. If this is an issue sticking with the deprecated FingerprintManager class is probably the best option.
