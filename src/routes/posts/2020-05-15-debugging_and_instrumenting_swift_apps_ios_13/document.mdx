# Introduction

# Background 
The adoption of the [Swift programming language](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) on the iOS platform has grown rapidly over the past few years, especially amongst larger organisations. More and more developers are opting towards writing new applications in Swift because of the many quality of life improvements it brings. In addition, many existing ObjC based applications are adopting a hybrid approach where they use both ObjC and Swift. This is facilitated by the [interoperability](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/imported_c_and_objective-c_apis/importing_swift_into_objective-c) of the two languages, making it very easy to use both languages in one application. Despite there being well defined interfaces between Swift and ObjC, the two languages have bespoke differences. Details on this can be found [here](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/ABIStabilityManifesto.md).
