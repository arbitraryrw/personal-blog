# Introduction
[R2con](https://rada.re/con/2019/) is a yearly conference about [radare2](https://rada.re/r/), a multi-platform, open-source, reverse engineering framework. As part of the conference they host a CTF, this year it was held a few days before the event, more details can be found [here](https://ctf.radare.org/challenges). The CTF consists of thirteen challenges across three levels: easy, medium, and hard. This post will walk through an easy level challenge that was particularly interesting, Land of Ecodelia, a text based adventure game.

## Background
I have been using R2 sporadically for the past year for small bits and pieces like checking for compiler flags / writing small scripts to patch opcodes. During this time I've never used it as my primary reversing tool on a project / crackme, what better time to start then at a conference all about [Radare2](https://rada.re/r/). The purpose of this post is to provide insight into practically applying R2 by itself and comment on the experience.

## Reverse Engineering Time

### Pre-analysis
The first step is to figure out what we're dealing with, by running the `file` utility against the binary we can see `ctf.file` is a statically linked ELF64 binary that has been stripped.

```bash
> file ctf.file
ctf.file: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, stripped
```

This information and more is available in R2 by running the `i` utility. R2 recognises the binary as being written in [go](https://golang.org/), as indicated by the `lang go` output. This is significant because each language has its own nuances, knowing them can significantly help when reversing. Notably, the `-A` flag simply instructs R2 to analyse all referenced code in the binary, this is important.


```c
> r2 ctf.file -A
[0x00452f70]> i
...
size     0x15e7a0
humansz  1.4M
...
arch     x86
...
bintype  elf
bits     64
...
lang     go
...
static   true
stripped true
...
```

After doing a bit of digging I was quickly concerned because:
1. I have little to no practical knowledge of [go](https://golang.org/) outside of reading blog posts from [RedNaga](https://rednaga.io/2016/09/21/reversing_go_binaries_like_a_pro/).
2. The Go compiler appears to insert a significant amount of boiler plate code, as illustrated by the size of the binary.
3. The low-level calling convention used by the Go compiler on x86-64 targets is memory-heavy. Meaning all arguments and return values are always passed on the stack.

With this in mind, the next step is to actually run the binary to see what it does. The program appears to present a series of questions to the user, if answered incorrectly the process terminates.

```
Welcome To The Greatest Adventure Of Your Life

In this game, I will ask you questions and youwill have to answer.Some
valid answers are y or n, but these are not the only ones. You will need
to figure out the rest by yourself :)
---------------------

```

### Static Analysis
This knowledge can now be applied to direct static analysis on the binary itself. Searching for known strings, such as the flag format `r2con{<flag>}`, is a good start. There are a number of hits for `r2con` when searching the whole binary using `izz`.

<img src={r2conFlagFormat} className={styles["screenshot"]} alt="logo" />

Unfortunately, `r2con2019{all_your_answers_in_order_without_spaces}` is not the flag. However, this does indicate that the answers to the questions are the flag. This can be confirmed by `NOP`ing out the logic that verifies the answers provided by the user matches the expected answer, however, this is not covered and does not provide the flag. The next step is to look at where the string hit is used in relation to the rest of the binary. This can be done by using `axt` to search for cross references to the string at `0x000c3185`.

<img src={r2conStringXrefs} className={styles["screenshot"]} alt="logo" />

The string is referenced in the function `sym.go.main.main` at `0x48a7d2`, however, it appears to be surrounded by a lot of logic that doesn't seem relevant.

<img src={crossReferencePdInFunc} className={styles["screenshot"]} alt="logo" />

To get a better understanding of what the code does, R2 can generate a function call graph using `agc`. The terminal output of this is not really legible in a blog format, so `agcd` can be used to generate a Graphviz file and output to a png using dot.

```bash
[0x0048a460]> agcd > your_graph.dot
[0x0048a460]> !dot -T png your_graph.dot -o your_graph.graph
```

<img src={mainFuncCallGraph} className={styles["screenshot"]} alt="logo" />

The call graph highlights that there are a number of interesting functions as part of `sym.go`, the `afl` utility can be used to list all the functions in the binary to see if there are any more. There are over 1500 hits to what is probably boiler plate go code, the search is further refined to `sym.go.main` to combat this. The output of the search did not reveal anything else particularly interesting so analysis is focused onto `sym.go.main.check` and `sym.go.main.encode`.

<img src={goMainFuncListAndCount} className={styles["screenshot"]} alt="logo" />

#### Check Function
The first step is to analyse the disassembly of the function, to print the disassembly for the function in R2 use `pdf @sym.go.main.check`. The function appears to be comparing values and dereferencing pointers in a loop, most likely comparing two objects.

<img src={checkFuncPdCode} className={styles["screenshot"]} alt="logo" />


This becomes significantly clearer when viewing the function's control flow graph, use the `agf` utility to print the basic block function graph. The instruction at address `0x0048a46a` looks interesting as it is comparing two dereferenced pointer values. Additionally, the instruction at address `0x0048a48d` also appears interesting as it is comparing two dereferenced pointer values at an offset. Take note of the `0x0048a46a` and `0x0048a48d` addresses as it will feed into later analysis.

<img src={checkFuncBasicBlocksGraph} className={styles["screenshot"]} alt="logo" />

#### Encode Function
The next step is to look at the `sym.go.main.encode` function. Print the disassembly of the function using `pdf @sym.go.encode` and generated a control flow graph just like before. The function looks like it is doing some form of encoding as can be seen by the loops and `XOR` instructions. Generally speaking, `XOR` instructions are usually interesting in CTFs and the one at `0x0048a32f` is no exception. Furthermore, this specific `XOR` is positioned quite late in the function which suggests it might be where the magic happens in an encoding function.

<img src={encodeFuncBasicBlocksGraph} className={styles["screenshot"]} alt="logo" />

### Dynamic Analysis
The next step is to take the information gathered from static analysis and use it to drive dynamic analysis to get a better understand of what is going on. The R2 inbuilt debugger can be used to facilitate this, attach a debugger to the process by running `r2 -d ctf.file`. Then set breakpoints at the points of interest `0x0048a46a`, `0x0048a48d` and `0x0048a32f` by using the `db <addr>` command. Then continue execution in the debugger session by running the `dc` command. The breakpoint at `0x0048a32f` hit first, dump the values of the registers by executing the `dr` command.

<img src={encodeFuncBreakpoint} className={styles["screenshot"]} alt="logo" />

The encode function breakpoint at `0x0048a32f` targets the instruction `xor r10d, edx`. Notably, the instruction above `0x0048a32f` at `0x0048a32b` appears to be referencing `RSI` at an offset. This means that the value stored in `RDX` is not static and is an offset to `RSI`, meaning it will change with each loop (unless the next offset contains the same value).

```c
...
0x0048a32b      0fb61416       movzx edx, byte [rsi + rdx]
0x0048a32f      4131d2         xor r10d, edx
...
```

The `r10` register contains the value entered by the user, in this case `y`. The `RDX` register contains the key, in this case `n`. Notably, the full key can be seen in `RSI` from the stack, this is because `RDX` contains an offset value of `RSI`. R2 allows you to easily query data in different formats by using the `? <value>` command.

<img src={encodeFuncRegisterValueConvert} className={styles["screenshot"]} alt="logo" />

Now that the key and logic for the encode function is clear, the execution of the binary can again continue by running `dc`. The next hit is the breakpoint at `0x0048a46a`.

```c
...
0x0048a460      488b442410     mov rax, qword [arg_10h]
0x0048a465      488b4c2428     mov rcx, qword [arg_28h]
0x0048a46a      4839c8         cmp rax, rcx
...
```

The instruction `cmp rax, rcx` at this address compares two dereferenced pointer values stored in `RAX` and `RCX`. The value of these registers are both `0x02`.

<img src={checkFuncBreakpoint} className={styles["screenshot"]} alt="logo" />

This looks like it may be comparing the length of the user's answer against the expected length, performing a length check. This can be confirmed by re-running the binary and entering `yy` instead of `y`. Observe that the value of `RDX` is still `0x02`, however, `RAX` is now `0x04` - 4 bytes instead of 2.

<img src={checkFuncBreakpoint2} className={styles["screenshot"]} alt="logo" />

Now that the expected length of the answer can be extracted, the execution of the binary can continue by running `dc` again. The next hit is the breakpoint at `0x0048a48d`.

```c
...
0x0048a485      0fb6341a       movzx esi, byte [rdx + rbx]
0x0048a489      0fb63c19       movzx edi, byte [rcx + rbx]
0x0048a48d      4038fe         cmp sil, dil
...
```

The instruction at this address compares `RSI` and `RDI`, these registers are dereferencing pointer values at an offset from `RDX` and `RCX`. This means that  `RDX`/`RCX` contain the full objects, and `RSI`/`RDI` contain the current index of the object being compared. The register values confirm that `RCX` and `RDX` contain addresses to pointers, this is verified by using `px` to print the hexdump of the addresses stored in each register.

<img src={checkFuncBreakpointFirstLoop} className={styles["screenshot"]} alt="logo" />

Continue the execution of the binary again by running `dc` to see if the instruction is iterating through an object. The same breakpoint hits again and the `RSI`/ `RDI` registers contain the subsequent pointer value `0x17`, in addition the `RBX` register is updated to indicate the base index of the loop.

<img src={checkFuncBreakpointSecondLoop} className={styles["screenshot"]} alt="logo" />

Taking the key from the encode function for the first question `0x6e` and `XOR`ing it with the value `0x17` reveals the the answer ``"y"``. R2 again offers a useful feature to perform this calculation by running `? <val1> ^ <val2>`.

<img src={xorKeyAndAnswer} className={styles["screenshot"]} alt="logo" />

### Executing Attack
Now that each of the pieces of the puzzle have been reversed, it's time to put everything together. The snippet below simply sets up the breakpoints and uses the `dbc` utility to automatically run a command when a breakpoint is hit, this is used to extract the values of interest identified during dynamic testing at each breakpoint.

```c
> cat config.txt

#Encode Function
db 0x0048a32f
# Print key for current byte
dbc 0x0048a32f dr rdx

# Compare Function
db 0x0048a46a
# Get the expected length
dbc 0x0048a46a dr rcx

# Compare byte value
db 0x0048a48d
# Get the correct value
dbc 0x0048a48d dr rcx
```

The config file can be passed into a R2 session through the `-i` flag, as seen below. Notably, breakpoints / the commands assigned to them can be verified by running the `db` command by itself.

```c
r2 -d ctf.file -i setup.txt
[0x00452f70]> db
0x0048a32f - 0x0048a330 1 --x sw break enabled cmd="dr rdx" cond="" name="0x0048a32f" module="<path>/ctf.file"
0x0048a46a - 0x0048a46b 1 --x sw break enabled cmd="dr rcx" cond="" name="0x0048a46a" module="<path>/ctf.file"
0x0048a48d - 0x0048a48e 1 --x sw break enabled cmd="dr rdi" cond="" name="0x0048a48d" module="<path>/ctf.file"
```

To demonstrate how this attack would work in practice, the process developed is applied against the second question. As the length of the answer is unknown, the first step is to figure out the expected answer length. Step through the question until `0x48a46a` and print the result of the `RDX` register, this contains the value `0x0a`. `0x0a` is `10` in decimal, a single char is two bytes so `10/2=5`, meaning the answer to the next question is five characters long.

<img src={guessingLengthOfKey} className={styles["screenshot"]} alt="logo" />

The next step is to get the encoding keys and the encoded answer. The keys are different for each byte of the encoded answer, as can be seen by the value of the `RDX` register at the `0x0048a32f` breakpoint changing after each hit. Additionally, the full encoded answer `01 0356 061d` can be found by printing the pointer address stored in `RCX` when `0x0048a48d` is hit.

<img src={extractingEncodedAnswer} className={styles["screenshot"]} alt="logo" />

The final step is to decode each individual byte of the answer with each respective key.

```c
0x6f ^ 0x01 = n
0x66 ^ 0x03 = e
0x20 ^ 0x56 = v
0x63 ^ 0x06 = e
0x6f ^ 0x1d = r
```

The answer to the second question is _never_, and this allows the application to progress to the next question.

<img src={inputCorrectAnswer} className={styles["screenshot"]} alt="logo" />

These exact same steps are repeated for every question. A Python script can be used to speed up the `XOR`ing as seen below. The snippet simply `XOR`s an array of keys against an array of encoded answers.

```python
import r2pipe

r2 = r2pipe.open('-')

keys = [
"0x0000006f",
"0x00000066",
"0x00000020",
"0x00000063",
"0x0000006f",
"0x0000000a"
]

encoded_bytes = [
"0x01",
"0x03",
"0x56",
"0x06",
"0x1d"
]

answer = ''

for index, eb in enumerate(encoded_bytes):
    res = r2.cmd('? {}^{}'.format(eb, keys[index])).split('\n')
    print("-> eb({}) ^ key({}) = {}".format(eb, keys[index], res[6][-2]))
    answer +=res[6][-2]

print("-"*20, "Answer", "-"*20)
print (answer)
```

<img src={scriptedDecodeAnswer} className={styles["screenshot"]} alt="logo" />

Once this process has been completed against all of the questions to get all of the answers, concatenate all of the answers to construct the flag:

```
r2con2019{yneverbothuseriouswhatlightthetorchiguessiopenitturntheknobWITHAKEYIUSEAKEY}
```

<img src={allAnswers} className={styles["screenshot"]} alt="logo" />

<img src={submitFlagToR2Ctf} className={styles["screenshot"]} alt="logo" />

## Conclusion
Land of Ecodelia is a really interesting and creative CTF challenge. The mechanic of making the flag a concatenation of each answer is really smart, it forces the attacker to play the game and think - I really enjoyed that. In addition, this challenge forced me to learn more about Go which was annoying but also rewarding, so all in all I really enjoyed it.

In regards to R2, the tool is extremely powerful and has a great community supporting it. Despite all of its shortfalls and limitations (which I encountered many of), it really is impressive, especially considering it is free and open-source. If you are new to R2 I would highly recommend starting out with [Cutter](https://cutter.re/), the official GUI platform build on Radare2, it takes away a lot of the pain and it has a really nice UI. Alternatively, if you like a bit more of a challenge you can use tools like r2lrn or r2golf to practice using R2 and get some hands on experience.

If you're interested in finding out more about the CTF / want to get a different perspective I would recommend checking out the following write-ups: [xermicus](https://gist.github.com/xermicus/40e43b89f29aafe9c9e303cb421868c9) and [bananamafia](https://bananamafia.dev/post/r2ctf-2019/).
